The following timing report describes the performance of the principal
AKA BondOAS Library operations.  The timings were conducted on our
test machine which has a 2.6gHz CPU and is running Linux.

The performance on your machine will differ.  You can run the
benchmark program which is distributed in the lib sub-directory of
this release.  The program provides a relative measure of the
performance of the machine it runs on, versus our baseline machine.

The AKA Library performance on your machine will approximately be the
calculations per second reported in the timing documentation below
multipled by the average of the cpu benchmarks.
