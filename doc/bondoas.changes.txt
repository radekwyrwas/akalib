Changes
-------
2.12 (November, 2013)
---------------------
Additions:
Simple fixed rate mortgages are now supported as a bond type.
Valuation methods accept as input Quote object which can be any of price, OAS
	or a yield.
Added YieldToWorst() and PriceToWorst().
Added methods for AssetSwapSpread() and ISpread().
Added method to define an Interest Rate Model using zero curve rates.
C API supports notification settings (C++ API already did).
Added methods to set/get InterestRateModel long volatility.
Added methods and documentation to C to C++ compatibility layer
	(see akaapi_compatibility.hpp). 
Added Initialization::ShutdownAutomatically() to configure shutdown behavior.

Behavior Changes:
The interest of interest at maturity instruments is based on the number of
	days from dated date to maturity; the yield is semiannually compounded
	unless specified otherwise.
Notification days default behavior no longer skips over weekends.
Warning issued when sinking schedule and face amount indicate that
	bond is retired prior to maturity.
Warning rather than error when outstanding amount is below 0.1% of face,
	schedule is trusted instead.
Warning rather than error if specified last coupon date (lcdate) is not
	cyclical with specified first coupon. Ignores last coupon date.
Default tax rates changed to 40, 40, 20 (income, short-term capital gains,
	long-term capital gains) from 35, 15, 15

Enhancements:
Improved handling of odd first and last coupons.
Simplified solved interest rate model Compatibility mode and deprecated
	InterestRateModel::EnableCompatibility();

Fixes:
Accrued on flow was in percent of par rather than pennies.
Date class year fraction calculations ignored Day Count.
InterestRateModel copy constructor did not work correctly when
	used to create a forward rate curve.
Multi-thread support in the copy constructor of a solved InterestRateModel
	was not working correctly.

After Tax Additions:
Added DeminimisPrice() and IssueYield() methods.


2.11 (August, 2013)
------------------
Additions:
Support for after-tax valuation and municipal bond valuation in C++ API.

Enhancements:
Notification delay handles weekends, holidays, and business day counting.
Improved handling of interest at maturity bonds.
Improved interface for end-of-month rule.
Valuation of near options computes time interval to option to match accrued.

Fixes:
Correctly compute accrued for actual/actual bonds in irregular coupon periods.
Conform to Bloomberg end-of February behavior for 30/360 bonds.

Distribution:
The library file names are now all consistently bondoas followed by the
	library type.  The names no longer contain the operating system
	 and architecture as these are in the directory name.  Symlinks
	(or under Windows direct copies) are used to maintain backward
	 compatibility.
Sun Sparc release is renamed from solaris to sunsparc.  Symlinks are used to
	maintain backward compatibility.
Improve and expand documentation.
Improve java example application.

Fix reporting of yields when there are no daycount days remaining; now report zero

Distribution:

Added AKA_msg_suppress()
Improved multi-threaded support by adding additional mutexes to reduce
    inter-thread context waits
Fixed daycount math for ACT/360 when period is less than a year but greater than
    360 days; fixes potential crash in price conversion to/from yields
Fixed handling of off-cycle sinking fund dates when next sink is before next
    option or regular flow; fixes potential crash in interest at maturity
    bonds with off-cycle sinks
Fixed after-tax valuation handling of holder's basis to account for accrued of
    off-cycle calls

2.03 (April, 2012)
-----------------
fixed spot duration (default/usual behavior is par duration, so this rarely
    applies) at zero OAS for bonds with options; also improved performance of
    spot duration valuation
fixed modified duration for sinking fund instruments
AKATreeFitRun() is now deprecated

2.02 (March, 2012)
------------------
major performance enhancements (y.m.m.v.):
    4.8x faster fitting of curves to a tree
    6.2x faster computation of an oas from a price
    13x faster computation of an oas from a price for sinking fund bonds
    3.5x faster computation of fair value from an oas
    10x faster computation of fair value from an oas for sinking fund bonds
    2x faster yield calculations
added AKAYieldToWorstEx() and AKABondValueYieldsEx() for cash flow yields
added support for off-cycle sinking fund dates
improved valuation of sinking fund bonds:
    the acceleration option had been slightly overvalued in high volatility
      rate environments, particularly if the bond was callable;
    the presence of a call option caused principal flows to be overvalued;
    note that these two effects could cancel each other out and that there
      will be very little observable change in valuations.
fixed yield calculations bugs:
    cash flow yields were wrong for sinking funds without call options
    long last coupons could cause a crash during calculation of muni yields
    irregular coupon flows could be missed on the pvdate before the flow
fixed performance issue in scenario analysis when valuing multiple bonds
    using the same trees
fixed setting of accumulation for sinking fund bonds
fixed fair value moving in jumps with rising, in-the-money call schedule
set default message pop-order to fifo
fixed last/first coupon agreement for very short bonds which in rare cases
    caused bond yield calculation to fail

2.00 and 2.01 internal releases only.

1.87 (November, 2011)

1.86 (August, 2011)
-------------------

 calling AKABondDuration().

 basis points to shift in order that a down shifted tree can always
 be created in low interest rate environments.
Provide new function AKATreeFitShift2() to facilitate generating shifted
 trees.

 architectures were already optimal).

1.72 (January, 2007)
--------------------
Fix rounding error causing out of the money options could show a very (< .001)
