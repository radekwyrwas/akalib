Library Names

The Bondoas(tm) libraries are released in both static and dynamic
versions.  Both versions are named bondoas.  The dynamic version is in
this lib directory.  The static version is in the static/ sub-directory.

Historical Library Names Backward Compatibility

Prior to release 2.11 AKA API libraries were named aka followed by the
operating system and architecture.  The library name was then suffixed
by its linkage, e.g., _dynamic.  All libraries were in the lib
directory.  For backward compatibility the old names are preserved.
However, these names are deprecated and may not be supported in future
releases.  Under unix the historical name is symlinked to the current
name.  Under Windows the current file is copied to the historical
name.  The following list gives the historical names and the
corresponding current names:

akawin32_mt.lib -> static/bondoas.lib
akawin32_md.lib -> static/bondoas_md.lib
akadll.dll -> bondoas.dll
akadll.lib -> bondoas.lib

Microsoft C/C++ /MD and /MT Compilation

The Microsoft compiler requires the C run-time library linkage to be
specified at compile time by using either the /MD or /MT compilation
switch.  These switches determine which MSC library is expected to be
linked with the object (or library containing the object) when
creating an executable or dll.  The Microsoft documentation specifies:
"All modules passed to a given invocation of the linker must have been
compiled with the same run-time library compiler option."  The default
bondoas static library is compiled with /MT.  The static/
sub-directory also contains bondoas_md.lib in which the objects were
compiled with /MD.  For more information about these compile switches
please refer to the Microsoft compiler documentation.
